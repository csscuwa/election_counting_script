Optional Preferential Voting for the CSSC:
	The system of counting votes for the CSSC requires a candidate to obtain an absolute majority (more than 50 per cent of the formal votes) to be elected.

	Firstly, all the number '1' formal first preference votes are counted for each candidate. If no candidate has an absolute majority of first preference votes, counting of votes then proceeds as outlined below.


Step 1: The candidates are ranked according to how many formal first preference votes they have received in the election.

Step 2: If no candidate has an absolute majority, the candidate who has received the fewest first preference votes is excluded and all the ballot papers held by that candidate are transferred to the continuing candidates, according to the next available preference expressed on each ballot paper.

Step 3: The process of excluding the candidate who has the fewest votes continues until a single candidate has an absolute majority of the votes.

Step 4: The candidate who has an absolute majority of votes is elected.

In the event of a tie, the absolute majority rule is ignored and the count is reconsidered. In the extremely unlikely event there remains a tie at each stage of the count where there is no decernable winner.
The returning officers must come to an agreement on who shall be elected. They may select this candidate in any means they see fit.
Them casting what would effectively be an additional vote shall be left as an absolute last resort.
